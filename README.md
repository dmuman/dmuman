**Hi everyone**, I'm a total newbie here (03/22/2024). 
I'm in my 3rd year at the Ukrainian university - KNEU. And in my 2nd year at the Portuguese university - ULisboa FCUL. 
I started coding about *six months ago* (around September 2023 - I was working on a bunch of group projects for my university).
*Even though my first experience was at high school (almost 5 or 6 years ago) when my (best) friend was trying to teach me HTML and CSS. Near that time my uncle also was trying to teach me Java.*
Two projects using **HTML/CSS and JavaScript**. And two in **Python**.
Now I'm working on projects in **Python** and the **MERN** stack (also for the university).
But I'm also trying to create something for myself. To learn the **MERN** stack.
There will also be **ML**-related projects (at least I hope so).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on two uni projects **(MERN and Python)**.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **MERN** stack and **Python for ML**.
- ðŸŒ± Languages that I was trying to learn/currently learning: **C++, Java, Python, JavaScript (including frameworks), HTML and CSS, English, Portuguese**. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on some **simple ML and MERN projects**.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with **ML**.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: **@raccoon_dmytro** on the Instagram or via emails: {personal: udmitro87@gmail.com, work: umanskyi.dmytro@gmail.com}.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like dinosaurs and astronomy.

**My projects (at least those to which I have access as the creator)**:

- Python project for the second semester (still in work): [Click](https://github.com/dmuman/Programming-2-project)
