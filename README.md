**Hi everyone**, I'm a beginner here. 
I'm in my 4th year at the Ukrainian university - KNEU. And in my 3rd year at the Portuguese university - ULisboa FCUL. 
I started coding around September 2023 - I was working on a bunch of group projects for my university.
*Even though my first experience was at high school (almost 5 or 6 years ago) when my (best) friend was trying to teach me HTML and CSS. Near that time my uncle also was trying to teach me Java.*
Up to now, I have done:
Two uni projects using **HTML/CSS and JavaScript**. 
Three uni projects in **Python**. (One is unfinished).
One uni project using the **MERN** stack.
Currently, I'm working on my **ML** projects (while learning it).
I was also trying to create something for myself. To learn the **MERN** stack. But understood that it was not for me. Maybe I'll get back to it soon.
There will also be **ML**-related tutorial that I'm translating into the Ukrainian language.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my **Machine Learning** projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **ML** concepts and Python libraries.
- ðŸŒ± Languages that I was trying to learn/currently learning: **C++, Java, Python (including some libraries for ML), JavaScript (including frameworks), HTML and CSS, English, Portuguese**. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on some **simple ML projects**.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with **ML**.
